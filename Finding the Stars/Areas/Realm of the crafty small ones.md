More commonly known as Bracklen, the homeworld of the Dwarves and Goblins

Dwarves live deep in the earth, mining for raw materials and food. The heat from the planets core allows for a special kind of farming, allowing these people to rarely, if ever, climb to the surface of the planet. 
They make use of designs and inventions discarded or dropped by the Goblins on the surface to dig further and improve their way of life.

Goblins live on the surface, basking in the light of the green sun. The harmful rays of the sun tends to turn the skin of anyone who spends enough time under it, a sickly shade of green, a symptom of something much worse. Due to this, Goblins who live in their homeworld, tend to have slightly lower life-expectancy, and their last few years are generally considered.. unpleasant. 
Along with this illness, middle-aged Goblins have a tendency to give into a certain kind of madness... or is it genius? 
Goblins "borrow" materials from the Dwarves, to do their strange creations.
It is commonly known that a Goblin was the first creator of the motorised weapons used in the modern age. Elves, however, were the ones to bring the means to perfect them.
Goblin inhabitants of the [[Realm of Humanity]] retain their green skin. There is some strife between Bracklen inhabitants, and other Goblins, as Bracklen Goblins believe the ones who flee the sun to be cowards, unwilling to give their all in the name of progress.
