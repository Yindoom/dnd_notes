# McCring

## Old dying head 
## Younger De Facto leader man
### The Nameless
A group of three [[Pathfinder]]s, who serve the dynasty. 

The Nameless used to be part of a larger group, during the last McRing/McCall "war", working for McRing, but Domnall deviced a plan that killed everyone but the three of them, at the expense of a large number of Domnall's own forces. 
McCall head was fully aware that the victory would be pyrrhic.

### Engin
The first Nameless, a barbarian Dwarf who reluctantly takes on missions, mainly because he like fighting. 
The unforeseen kindness of the Friendship Fuckers has sown a bit of discord in his mind

### Zewei 
The only one with a semblance of actual loyalty towards McCring.
