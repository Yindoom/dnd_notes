Benefitting from atrocities of ages gone by?

They have been tasked with reinstating the son of a disgraced noble. To do this there are a couple of things that must be done, not least of which is keep the lineage going, by keeping the child alive. 

Pros of sticking with the McCall clan:
- The son is a genuine good guy, who, while naive, wants the best for their territory and all that
- Their public image is that of benevolent philanthropist heads 
- First come first serve loyalty?
- officially abolished slavery within their own organisation 

Const:
- Grandfather is a piece of shit, who had his own son killed for some reason // TODO
- Grandfather is probably a pedophile
- They still effectively use slave labor (see real world prison industrial whatever)
