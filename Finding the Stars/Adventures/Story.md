where do i want this to go, where do I want it to end

What do the characters want, and where do they want to go?

## Hepta
Money. To stay at home.

## Handy
Money. To brew? I guess?

## Okt
idk


They got money.. so now what? Outside of just trying to kill them, what can motivate them?
Clearly not risk takers, 

Death of McRing or Rian?
