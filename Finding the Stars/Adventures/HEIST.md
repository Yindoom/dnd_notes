The crew has to infiltrate a bank (or something similar) to steal something (like an access card to the family's bank or some shit)


## The facility
A top security vault, building, located underneath the fourth ring (for tax reasons or something)


While many of the treasures are a variety of physical goods, most of the money is found in a credit card, a small key-card like device, containing cryptographically sealed credits.
