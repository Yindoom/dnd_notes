## Rainbow's Jewel 
fucking destroyed don't exist anymore


# Gardenia
Main city in the desert. Usually thriving due to the trade in precious gems found deep in the sand of the desert, however with their main trade-route being shut down, trade has slowed down significantly, leaving the citizens hungry. Main "trade" is now done with [[Eysland#Dragon's Tooth]], although this is more or less a formality, as Dragon's Tooth and Gardenia engage in a form of mutual aid, sending supplies to each other, as needed, due to over 50% of each of their imports being stunted by the closed borders.
