# The Genius Sculptor
A Sculptor in Meridian is gaining notoriety for his statues of humanoids, as horrific as they are lifelike.

He used to apprentice with another sculptor or great renown, in [[Eastern Divide#Sun Home]]. The Master used a series of spells and magic processes to form his incredible creations, but he fell into a deep depression when he lost his powers. Now the Apprentice works tirelessly in his shop in Meridian to re-build his and his teachers reputation.
During his work he found his work lacking, until he somehow found a Basilisk, he has been using to petrify citizens. He's fairly buff, owing to his time beating on rocks.


### Progress
1. Our heroes have seen him in passing, when Warren the Tabaxi delivery man delivered a set of gems to him, on their first quest.
2. They have received their quest scroll, with multiple missing people requests in the Meridian area.
