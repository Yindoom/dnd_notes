The Druidic circle to which Moose belongs

Led by Shephard Minas. He wears a woolen vest, and a simple shephard staff. He smells like goat. He has a following of 5 druids, usually keeping the others busy elsewhere with tasks and missions and stuff. The exact number of druids in the circle is unknown, but presumed to be fairly small as it is new and stuff
