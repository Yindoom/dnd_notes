Skaty, the young human girl with the burn scars. Originally from [[Rainstone##Rainbow's Jewel]], survivor of the Jewel Incident. She needs a picture. She lives with her adoptive parents who came to the "village" to start a new life with their timid daughter.

Belwind, upper middle age tabaxi, adoptive father of Skaty. Used to be a trader, on the route between Meridian and Sand country place I forget the name

Miriam, middle age dwarf, adoptive mother of Skaty. Used to be a sand miner, digging for precious stones and gems in the desert.

Both decided to settle down in the Eastern Union for a fresh start, for themselves and Skaty, following the events of the Meridian riots and the Incident.

Old Man Jerma, the original inhabitant of the village. Elderly human, who has lived in the little valley for a very long time. Made his living hunting. He makes himself useful by supplying wood from the forest behind his hut.

They have a dog named Courage, he's kind of old, and doesn't have much energy anymore.


In the forest, in a hut on the border between the fey wild and our world, lives a surprisingly smart Orc, by the name of Gob. A survivor of the war on the Unicorn Island, he was granted enlightenment, simply through his proximity to the Vortex




There is an old man named Morlen in the village with the bridge
Myllandra is the keeper of the souther mountain trail
