Following the fall and disappearance of Zargothrax, the source of magic has vanished.

A great metaphysical whirlpool now exists where the Unicorn Island once was. A select few can tap into the neverending churning vortex, and channel said energy into spells

Sorcerers and Bards have a direct connection with the vortex

Druids have a vpn connection, requiring attunement to a druid circle to be able to channel particular spells, such as wild shape.

Clerics, Paladins, and Warlocks all generally do not have a gateway to the vortex, but rather draw their power from an otherworldly entity, known as gods and demons


Wizards do not have an internal gateway, relying instead on an arcane artefact, usually a book inscribed with a number of spells. In theory, anyone could make use of the rituals and spells contained within any one spellbook, in practice this is much less likely to be the case however.

A spellcasting focus must resonate with the Core
